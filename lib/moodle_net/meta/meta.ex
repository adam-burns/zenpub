defmodule MoodleNet.Meta do

  The meta system is for solving the problem of dynamism being
  required by parts of the system - that is, for a foreign key to be
  able to identify a row in any one of a predetermined list of tables.

  A `MoodleNet.Meta.Table` identifies a participating table.

  A `MoodleNet.Meta.Pointer` is a reference to an entry in a
  participating table.

  ## Rules
  
  Participating tables must:

  * Have an entry in `MoodleNet.Meta.Table`

  * Have a UUID primary key which is also a foreign key which
    references `MoodleNet.Meta.Pointer`

  * Have a deletion trigger that cascades the delete to
    `MoodleNet.Meta.Pointer` (TODO - delete the pointer for now and it will cascade)

  Insertion operations on participating tables must:

  * Insert a Pointer in the same transaction as an insert into the
    other table. This is so that in the event of the other insert
    failing, the Pointer will also be removed.
