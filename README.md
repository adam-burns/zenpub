# MoodleNet Federated Server 

## About the project

This is the MoodleNet back-end, written in Elixir (running on the Erlang VM, and using the Phoenix web framework). The client API uses GraphQL. The federation API uses [ActivityPub](http://activitypub.rocks/) The MoodleNet front-end is built with React (in a [seperate repo](https://gitlab.com/moodlenet/clients/react?nav_source=navbar)).

This codebase was forked from [CommonsPub](http://commonspub.org/) (project to create a generic federated server, based on the `ActivityPub` and `ActivityStreams` web standards) which was originally forked from [Pleroma](https://git.pleroma.social/pleroma/pleroma).
